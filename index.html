    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Even if the mixtape looked successful, Nettspend's fanbase didn't like the project, most feeling that the mixtape wasn't worth the wait or had bad song selection for the tracklist. The roll out for the mixtape was very successful but all of the push didn't work out in the end.</p>
